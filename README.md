Brain Machine interface data analysis involves:
* Dimensionality reduction
* Unsupervized clustering
* Scoring these clusters based on their unique data representation quality
* Sorting these clusters based on the score and pick top N candidates

## Run code
main.m is the orchestrator script for the project.
Since this repository only contains sample source code, it doesn't have all packages to run the orchestrator script successfully.
